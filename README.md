Hello my name is Isaias, 21 years old, actually i'm a full-time student of the engineering of 
Computational Systems.

I like to browse the different systems operatives, but i'm using Arch Linux as my main desktop
because i liked how i can put only the things i want.

On the other hand I also like to program on Java, because i just love it.
